# Master Technical Specification: The Adaptive, Multi-Source Trading Agent

## Tier 1: Baseline Model - Summary & Key Findings
**Objective:** To establish a foundational ML pipeline capable of collecting diverse data, engineering predictive features, and training a baseline model.
**Status:** COMPLETE.
**Key Outcomes:**
- A robust data pipeline now exists for market (Crypto, Forex, Metals), sentiment (news headlines), and economic calendar data.
- A full suite of advanced features (Kalman Filters, Hurst Exponent, RSI, Volatility) has been successfully engineered.
- A baseline XGBoost model was trained and saved, achieving ~54% accuracy on the test set. While not yet profitable, this serves as a crucial benchmark.
- **SHAP analysis provided critical insights into the model's "brain":**
  - **Confirmation of Feature Importance:** The model relies heavily on our engineered features, especially the Kalman-filtered (smoothed) prices and the Hurst Exponent, validating our feature engineering strategy.
  - **'Buy' Signal Logic:** The model's decision to "Buy" is most strongly influenced by a high Hurst Exponent (indicating a trending BTC market) and rising gold prices (suggesting a potential "risk-on" sentiment).
  - **Identified Weakness:** The model struggles significantly with predicting 'Hold' conditions, indicating a weakness in sideways or non-trending markets. This is a primary target for future improvements.

## Tier 2: Strategy Refinement & Vectorized Backtesting
**Objective:** To rigorously evaluate the baseline model's performance on historical data and establish a framework for iterative improvement.
**Status:** PENDING.
**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Design and Build a Vectorized Backtesting Engine:** Create a Python script that can simulate trades based on model predictions and calculate performance.
- [ ] **Integrate Model Predictions:** Feed the saved XGBoost model's predictions into the backtester.
- [ ] **Define Key Performance Metrics (KPIs):** The backtester must calculate Profit & Loss (PnL), Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.
- [ ] **Generate Performance Report:** Run the backtest on the held-out test set and generate an initial report and equity curve visualization.
